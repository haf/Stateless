# Stateless

This is a clone of the original stateless repository (owned by Nicholas Blumhardt), compiled for .NET 4.0 with additions for parallel invocation. Stateless is a base for exploration of generic and functional programming to drive workflow in .NET. It allows you to state machines and lightweight state machine-based workflows directly in .NET code.
